	<h2>HISTORY</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h4>Prehistoric, Ancient Indus Valley and Vedic periods</h4>
			<p>It is located in a fertile doab region between two rivers that was forested until the medieval period, but in which human habitation can be traced back to 2000 BC. Sites of archaeological importance have been found throughout the surrounding area. Various Indian conquerors who came from neighbouring regions through the ages included the Nandas, Maurya, Shunga, Yaudheya, Kushana, Gupta, Yasodharman, Vardhana, Maukhari, khatiks Notyial, Chandela, Muktapida, Ayuddhas, Gurjara-Pratihara, and Palas. All these have left legacies while their descendants in the region have first or last names that reflect these historical and at times also mythological, in cases such as Suryavanshi and Chandravanshi, kinships.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<h4>Mughal period</h4>
			<p>During the Mughal period, Akbar (1542-1605), Saharanpur became an administrative unit under the Province of Delhi. Akbar bestowed the feudal jagir of Saharanpur to the Mughal treasurer, Sah Ranveer Singh, an Agrawal Jain who laid the foundations of the present day city on the site of an army cantonment. The nearest settlements at that time were Shekhpura and Malhipur. Saharanpur was a walled city, with four gates: the Sarai Gate, the Mali Gate, the Buria Gate and the Lakhi Gate. The city was divided into the neighbourhoods os Nakhasa Bazar, Shah Behlol, Rani Bazar and Lakhi Gate. The ruins of Shah Ran Veer Singh's old fort can still be seen in the Chaudharian locality of Saharanpur, not far from the better known 'Bada-Imam-bada'. He also built a large Jain temple in Muhallah/Toli Chaundhariyan, it is now known as the 'Digamber-Jain Punchayati Mandir'.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4>British colonial period (1803-1947 AD)</h4>
			<p>When India rebelled in 1857 against the East India Company's occupation, an event now referred to as the First War of Indian Independence, inhabitants of the Saharanpur and the present-day Muzaffarnagar Districts took part in the uprising. The centre of freedom fighters' operations was Shamli, a small town in the Muzaffarnagar region which was liberated for some time. After the uprising failed, British retribution was severe. Death and destruction were particularly directed against the Muslims of the region, whom the British considered the main instigators of the rebellion. Muslim society was devastated beyond recognition and when social reconstruction started, the cultural and political history of Muslims began to revolve around Deoband and Aligarh. Maulana Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi and Maulana Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, both proponents of the reformer Shah Waliullah's ideology for social and political rejuvenation, established a school in Deoband in 1867. It found popularity and global recognition as the Darul Uloom. Its founders' mission was twofold: to raise and disseminate a team of scholars able to awaken the religious and social consciousness of Muslims through peaceful methods and to make efforts, through them, to educate Muslims in their faith and culture; and to bring about a feeling of nationalism and national unity by promoting the concept of Hindu-Muslim unity and a united India. Muslim scholars in the city of Saharanpur were active supporters of this ideology and went on to establish the Mazahirul Uloom Saharanpur theological seminary six months later, along identical lines.</p>
			<p>In 1845 Chaudhary Rao Wazir-ud-din Khan, a descendant of Raja Ram Singh, came from Rajasthan to Saharanpur and subsequently converted to Islam. He took upo residence in Shaikpura Qudeem and became the great Zaminder of Shaikhpura Qudeem (Saharanpur). Choudhary Rao Wazir-ud-din Khan became a member and voter at the Mughal Durbar at the Red Fort in New Delhi. He was the richest person in Saharanpur with 27 thousand bega of land and was lord of 57 villages including Shaikhpura, Landohra, Tapri, Piragpur, Yousfpur, Badshapur, Harhati, Nazirpura, Santgarh, Lakhnor, Subri and Pathri in the district. British governors enjoyed cordial relations with Rao Wazir-ud-din and he received the title of royal family or Badsha-e-waqt (the king of his time). He died in 1895 at Sheikpura Qudeem (Saharanpur). He had two sons: Choudhary Rao Mashooq Ali Khan and Choudhary Rao Ghafoor Muhammad ali Khan. Rao Ghafoor Muhammad ali Khan had seven children; the eldest, Rao Maqsood Ali Khan was educated at Aligarh Muslim University. He wrote or copied many books in English and Persian and was the one and only one royal man of Saharanpur. He was the owner of a large property in the Saharanpur region or in Dheradun and received an award from the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, at Dehradun. His brothers migrated to Pakistan and England and he died in 1973 at Sheikpura Qudeem leaving four sons: Rao Ghulam muhi-ud-din Khan, Rao Zamier haider Khan, Rao yaqoob Khan and Rao Ghulam Hafiz.</p>
			<p>The British administration, which took over the Indian holdings of the East India Company as a colony in the aftermath of the 1857 rebellion, created the Muzaffarnagar district in 1901. This was carved out of the Saharanpur district, and both became part of the Meerut Division of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-12">
			<h4>Post-independence period (1947 AD - 21st century)</h4>
			<p>Until the end of British rule, the power and social prestige of descendants of the past ruling classes remained formidable, especially in the rural interiors. Often called the upper castes, they dominated the lower caste people. After independence, the conversion of the country to democracy enabled these under-privileged and ex-untouchable Dalit classes to move forward gradually in all fields in India. Late Master Kanshi Ram, the founder of the pro-Dalit Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), started his political career in Saharanpur. His protege Kumari Mayavati, a Dalit from Saharanpur, has ruled over Uttar Pradesh as a BSP Chief Minister four times and, after completing a full term in office, lost to the Samajwadi Party in the February 2012 assembly elections. The Jains and Aggarwals are influential business communities; the latter have "Agarwal Sabha" and elect their presidents annually.</p>
			<p>On 28 December 1988, Saharanpur district lost the region of Haridwar, which was made into a new district within the Saharanpur division. Subsequently, Haridwar district was taken out of Saharanpur division and merged with what is now Uttarakhand, a new state that was carved out of Uttar Pradesh on 9 November 2000. With this territorial reorganisation, Saharanpur lost many important places of religious and cultural heritage, including the city of Roorkee, which led to disappointment among the Saharanpur people. Political debate is still simmering on whether parts of Saharanpur, including the city itself, can be merged with Uttarakhand. Another political view is that a new state of Harit Pradesh should be carved out of the present Western Uttar Pradesh region.</p>

	<h2>CULTURE</h2>	
	<div class="row">
		<p>Saharanpur is similar to other cities in western Uttar Pradesh in language, dress, culinary habits, festivals, and other traditions and ceremonial functions, Mall, Cinemas, hotels, and eateries are available for entertainment. Local editions of Punjabi, Hindi, Urdu and English newspapers are published. Khadiboli is the lingua franca in which local Punjabi speakers are fluent. Pajyama and Kurta are traditional men's garments. Women wear a Patiala Suit and Salwar-kurti, that originates from the Punjab as many Punjabis live in Saharanpur. Ragni is a traditional method of story telling in the form of a poem. But people in this region have always welcomed a change as the time passes and these days one can easily notice people in western wear. A majority of the population here can be seen wearing traditional attires only at special occasions or during festive season. Saharanpur is a developing city where many elite branded stores are running successfully. People carry a modern approach when it comes to clothes, thoughts or standard of living.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="container-fluid" id="eco" style="display:none">
	<h2>ECONOMY AND TRADE</h2>	
	<div class="row">
	<p>Saharanpur is a flourishing business city and an important regional centre for the wholesale and retail trades, particularly in grain, timber, textiles, food and beverages.The trade can be divided into three categories:</p>
	<ul><li><i>Food - grains, vegetables and fruits. Milk and milk products.</i></li>
		<li><i>Agro Based Industries - The most important are sugar, gur, (cotton) textiles and cigarettes.</i></li>
		<li><i>Industrial Goods - paper, sugarcane, hosiery material and wood carving.</i></li>
	</ul>
	<p>The city's grain market receives agricultural produce from the surrounding doab. Anaaj Mandi is a wholesale market for grains and other agricultural produce located on Chilkana Road. The timber market traditionally receives supplies from the northern hilly forest regions to support the local cottage woodcarving industry and other demands. The wooden handicrafts industry is the basis of livelihood for half of the population and source of recognition globally. Beautiful art and utilitarian woodwork objects are displayed and sold in the market from near Ambala Road up to Chilkana Road. In the last few decades, Pul DalMandi has become a popular area for daily requirements while the Punjabi Market and Kamboh Katehra market have experienced a high volume of textile trade. Hosiery has become a significant cottage industry, supplying goods to Ludhiana market, other nearby cities, and Uttarakhand's markets. Hiran Maran is the hosiery market in Saharanpur.</p>
	<p>Historically, the common householder's market is centred in the compact area around the Jama Masjid landmark. Within a radius of less than half a kilometre around it, a network of narrow roads is lined with groups of shops selling commodities from jewellery to groceries. Main markets in the region include Nehru market, Shaheed Ganj, Naya Bazar, Sarrafa Bazar - known for a large number of jewellery shops, Halwai Hatta - well known for various shops offering food stuffs, Dinanath, Bartala Yadgar, Mor Ganj, Pansari Bazar- cities' wholesale stationery and paper market. Modern show rooms, retail outlets of branded goods, and branches of several major banks are located in the Court Road market, near the city's Civil Court and the Collectorate offices. The city does not yet have many shopping malls.</p>
	<p>A weekly spectacle is the busy Mangal Bazar (Tuesday Market) that springs up on the long road in Nehru Market and its surrounding areas, when the city's shops are closed for the weekly holiday. Household needs, tools, appliances and their parts are available; the quality and price are aimed at the lower-end customers.</p>
	<p>A multinational cigarette manufacturing company, the ITC Limited previously known as the Anglo-American Tobacco Company and the Imperial Tobacco Company, is located in Saharanpur. This factory was built in the 1930s by Baba Shib Dayal Bedi. He was the Municipal Commissioner of Saharanpur during this period. Cherisys Technologies has entered the city as an IT solutions provider after moving to the city from New Delhi. Cherisys Technologies was the first IT solutions provider in the city. Star Paper Mill, Sugar Mill, Hardboard Mill, Textile Mill, and Wood-seasoning Mill are other important industrial enterprises located in the city.</p>

	<h2>GEOGRAPHY & CLIMATE</h2>	
	<div class="row">
	<p>Geography of Saharanpur District presents many varieties of features and differs in general appearance than any other portion of the Doab and Gangetic plain as a whole. Saharanpur District forms the most northerly position of the Doab land which stretches between Ganga River and Yamuna River. Shivalik Hills rise above it on the northern frontier. The portion of Doab in which Saharanpur is situated was probably one of the first regions of upper India occupied by the Aryans colonizers as they spread eastward from Punjab. It is true that most of the area belongs to the upland Bangar which stretches in a continuous line up to Allahabad. Geography of Saharanpur District also includes low lying valley full of swamps and back waters with wide open grass plains and Tamarisk jungle. But in the north there are the steep hills of Shivalik chain which appear in a far more marked form in Saharanpur than any other district of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
	<p>Yamuna is the important river of the district. Apart from this Solani, Hindon, Ratmau, Nagdev have also played an important role in the physical reconstruction of the district. All the rivers of the district submerge either in Yamuna or in the Ganges. Saharanpur District has a tropical climate because of the proximity of the Himalayan region across this district. It is sub-humid region especially the upper Ganga plain areas. Saharanpur District records an average temperature around 23.3 degree during the course of the year. June is the hottest recorded month while January is the coldest one. Humidity is more in the western area as compared to the eastern region of Saharanpur. </p>

                                <p>The Saharanpur Botanical Gardens, known as the Company Garden and once known as Farahat-Bakhsh, was originally a pleasure ground set out by a local chief, Intazam ud-ullah.It was acquired by the British East India Company in 1817. Joseph Dalton Hooker says of this Botanical Garden:<br><i>"Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China, a fact I allude to, as many of my English readers may not be aware that the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore."</i></p>

			<b>Googhal Mela</b>
			<p>This fair has been happening in the same way for last 140 years. Nagar nigam makes the whole arrangement for the entire pandaal.<br>According to legend, the King of Patan, Raja Kunwar Pal Singh, had two daughters, namely Vachhal and Kachhal. After the marriage of both the daughters, Vachhal worshipped Guru Gorakhnath to be blessed with a son. When she was about to be blessed with a son, Kachhal came there and got blessed with two sons that actually belonged to her sister.

When this situation was revealed to Guruji, he blessed Vachhal with a son on the condition that Ghugghal would kill the sons obtained by Kachhal. To overcome this, Ghugghal performed a tapas in the forests for a long time, as a result of which, he was blessed as a Veer.</p></div>
			<div class="row"><dl><b>Shakumbri Mela</b>
			<p>The Shakti Peeth of Shakumbari is situated 40 km north of Saharanpur and is dedicated to the Shakumbari Devi. The history of this temple is not very clear as its architecture and images do not give any evidence regarding the period to which this temple belongs. According to some  stories, the idols present at this temple were installed here, by Adi Sankracharya, while performing his tapasya in the place.</p>
